description: A little tracker to highlight potential upticks in infection as we reopen the world 

---
# Everyones flexing their COVID DataScience skills

Countries world over shutdown their economies to flatten the curve.  We've finally seeing the benefits and we're moving to the 
next stage of managing this pandemic -active suppression. 
As we move through these phases, I thought I'd share a little tracker that I'd put together to track a few KPIs to monitor potential 
accelerations in infections. Basically answer the questions
*What countries have managed to minimize daily new infections?
*What mitigation stage is a country in?
*Whats your risk of infection if you're visiting a country?
