description: A little tracker to highlight potential upticks in infection as we reopen the world

# CoVid19- #PlottingTheCurve

Countries world over shutdown their economies to flatten the curve, I thought I'd spend a weekend 'PlottingTheCurve'.  

As we move to the next stage of managing this pandemic -active suppression.  I thought I'd share a little tracker to monitor which countries are successful, Vs which still have a way to go.

###Approach
*Growth Rate: [Ni(to)-Ni(t-1)]/Ni(t-1)
Ni -> New infections

As we plot the growth rate across countries, a few clear trends emerge
###1 Growth rate is stabilizing across the globe

###2 US leads the world in total cumulative infections but daily growth is much lower


###3 Different countries had very different periods of case acceleration


How can I use this metric.  To be honest, I would'nt recommend making decisions based on my above rought estimate.  This an amatuer efffort at best.  But, the metric indicates the state of infection management in the country.  ideally, travelling to a country with a a low Growth Rate and low Ni means that your chance of getting infected is very low. The country has managed to flatten the curve. on the other hand , if Ni is high, I would still rely on growth rate.  a high Ni but low growth rate means that country has managed to contain the spread. Relativly less likelihood of getting infected.  A high growth rate means that

means lower the likelyhood



countries are in 
accelerations in infections. Basically answer the questions
*What countries have managed to minimize daily new infections?
*What mitigation stage is a country in?
*Whats your risk of infection if you're visiting a country?
