# Chicago a.k.a Second City!
Fly over country.  All that area that you look at from the window of your plane when you board your flight in SFO and land at JFK.  TheUninteresting, Vast, Plain..... much like this blog post..  But boy was I wrong.  Chicago, you;ve left me a changed man.

After nearly 5 years of living in the states, I finally had a chance to make it to this part of the country..I finally made an extended trip in fly over country.. and what I found there was amazing.
